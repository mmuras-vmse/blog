title:  Repelling into VMware Volcano - A brief history of my deployments
---

2017-10-30


In the last year or so we built and deployed roughly 50 environments.  The company has a group of techs assigned to do the “pre-build” task/process: Configure HP iLO, Bios, Boot order, Raid Config, Install ESXi, Configure ESXi network, rack and wire server for VM build out.  
One of my original assignments within this project, document all processes necessary to build the VMware environment.  Moreover, I had to pay special attention to making sure the documents for these techs was: 1. step-by-step and 2. had to be ordered so the techs could focus on the “task” as a whole item (and not shift the work back to Architect team) until ESXi host is ready.  I was pretty certain that there would be a large batch of documentation for the step-by-step task.  However, I was a little surprised when I saw that it took roughly 60 pages (with pictures / screen shots). I also was pretty certain that I could successfully automate most of the tasks.

The first step in testing Automation for this environment was having a way to more effectively deploy ESXi.  The way we did this for years was by ISO on USB or by ISO from iLO virtual CD.  This is not a bad way to go if you have 5 or 10 servers.  However, this is not sustainable for us longterm.
